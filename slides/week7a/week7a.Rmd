* In the assignment 3, we analyzed the data from two experiments in which households were canvassed for support on gay marriage.

* The exercise was based on: LaCour, M. J., and D. P. Green. 2014. “[When Contact Changes Minds: An Experiment on Transmission of Support for Gay Equality.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1256151)” *Science* 346(6215): 1366–69.

* Canvassers were given a script leading to conversations that averaged about twenty minutes. A distinctive feature of this study is that gay and straight canvassers were randomly assigned to households and canvassers revealed whether they were straight or gay in the course of the conversation. The experiment aims to test the 'contact hypothesis,' which contends that out-group hostility (towards gays in this case) diminishes when people from different groups interact with one another.

.font150[
* Each observation of this data set is a respondent giving a response to a five-point survey item on same-sex marriage.  There are two different studies in this data set, involving interviews during 7 different time periods (i.e. 7 waves).  In both studies, the first wave consists of the interview before the canvassing treatment occurs. 

* Use the [gay.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umbertomig/intro-prob-stat-FGV/master/datasets/gay.csv) data set.
]

# Changing Minds on Gay Marriage

.font150[
* **Question 1**

* Using the baseline interview wave before the treatment is administered (wave == 1), examine whether randomisation was properly conducted. Base your analysis on the three groups of Study 1: 
  - 'Same-Sex Marriage Script by Gay Canvasser'
  - 'Same-Sex Marriage Script by Straight Canvasser'
  - 'No Contact.'
  
* Briefly comment on the results.
]

# Changing Minds on Gay Marriage

```{r}
gay <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umbertomig/intro-prob-stat-FGV/master/datasets/gay.csv")

# Study 1
wave1 <- filter(gay, wave == 1)

## Examine the randomization
tapply(wave1$ssm, wave1$treatment, mean)
```
---

# Changing Minds on Gay Marriage

.font150[
* The results show that before treatment, all three treatment groups show similar levels of baseline support for gay marriage on average. Thus, the randomization appears to have been done correctly.
]
---

# Changing Minds on Gay Marriage

.font150[
* **Question 2**

* The second wave of survey was implemented two months after the canvassing.  Using Study 1, estimate the average treatment effects of gay and straight canvassers on support for same-sex marriage, separately (wave == 2).  Give a brief interpretation of the results.

# Changing Minds on Gay Marriage

```{r}
# Study 2
w2_gay <- subset(gay, wave == 2 & study == 1 & 
                 treatment == "Same-Sex Marriage Script by Gay Canvasser")
w2_straight <- subset(gay, wave == 2 & study == 1 & 
                 treatment == "Same-Sex Marriage Script by Straight Canvasser")
w2_none <- subset(gay, wave == 2 & study == 1 & treatment == "No Contact")

# ATE for gay canvassers
mean(w2_gay$ssm) - mean(w2_none$ssm)
# ATE for straight canvassers
mean(w2_straight$ssm) - mean(w2_none$ssm)
```
---

# Changing Minds on Gay Marriage

.font150[
* Approval of gay marriage increased on average by  `r round(mean(w2_gay$ssm) - mean(w2_none$ssm), 3)` for gay canvassers and by `r round(mean(w2_straight$ssm) - mean(w2_none$ssm), 3)` for straight canvassers.

* **Question 3**

* Again using study 1, please check if the results persist in wave 7 of the study.  Give a brief interpretation of the results.

# Changing Minds on Gay Marriage

.font150[
* Approval of gay marriage increased on average by  `r round(mean(w7_gay$ssm) - mean(w7_none$ssm), 3)` for gay canvassers and by `r round(mean(w7_straight$ssm) - mean(w7_none$ssm), 3)` for straight canvassers. The results show that the effect for gay canvassers is persistent over time.

# For Loops in R

.font120[
* Basic structure
]
```{r loop01,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T,eval=F}
 for (i in X) {
    expression1
    expression2
    ...
    expressionN
}
```
.font120[
* Elements of a loop
    - `i`: counter (can use any object name other than `i`)
    - `X`: vector containing a set of ordered values the counter takes
    - `expression`: a set of expressions that will be repeatedly evaluated
    - `{ }`: curly braces to define the beginning and the end

* Indentation is important for the readability of code
]
---

# For Loops in R

.font150[
* .orange[Tip]: Code without loop first by setting the counter to a specific value
]
```{r tip,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T}
values <- c(2, 4, 6)
i <- 1
x <- values[i] * 3
cat(values[i], "times 3 is equal to", x, "\n")
```
---

# For Loops in R

.font150[
* Step by step: 
]
```{r loop02,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T,tidy=F}
# our vector
values <- c(2, 4, 6)
# empty vector for storing the results
results <- rep(NA, length(values))
# counter `i' will take values on 1, 2, ..., length(values) in that order 
for (i in 1:length(values)) {
# store the result as the ith element of `results' vector
    results[i] <- values[i] * 3
# print the values, you will not see this
    cat(values[i], "times 3 is equal to", results[i], "\n") 
}
```
---

# For Loops in R

.font150[
* Printing out an iteraction number can be helpful for debugging
]
```{r loop03,fig.align="center",tidy=F,message=F,cache=T,tidy=F}
values <- c(1, -1, 2)
results <- rep(NA, 3)
for (i in 1:3) {
    cat("iteration", i, "\n")
    results[i] <- log(values[i])

# Conditional Statements

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=720px></html> 

---

# General Conditional Statements

.font150[
* You already know how to write conditional statements in R: `ifelse()`

```{r if01,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T}
values <- 1:10
ifelse(values < 5, 0, 1)
```
]
---

# General Conditional Statements

.font150[
* But we can write conditional statements in a more general way:
]

.font120[
```{r if02,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T,eval=FALSE}
if (X) {
    expression1a
    ...
    expressionNa
} else if (Y) {
    expression1b
    ...
    expressionNb
} else {
    expression1c
    ...
    expressionNc
}
```
]
---

# General Conditional Statements

.font150[
* Elements of `if(){}else(){}`
  - `X`: logical statement returning either `TRUE` or `FALSE`
  - `Y`: additional statements also returning either `TRUE` or `FALSE`
  - `expression`: code chunks evaluated depending on the value of `X`
  
* Can be combined with for loops
]

# Example

.font120[
```{r if03,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T}
values <- 1:10                     # sequence from 1 to 10
results <- rep(NA, length(values)) # empty vector

# Loop
for (i in values) {
  if (values[i] < 5) {
    results[i] <- 0
} else if (values[i] == 5) {
    results[i] <- 5
} else {
    results[i] <- 1
}
}

# Print results
results
```

# Custom Functions in R

.font120[
* One of the best things about R is that users can create their own functions

* R packages are just collection of functions

* Custom functions save time and increase reliability. Basic syntax:

```{r fun,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T,eval=FALSE}
function_name <- function(arg_1, arg_2, ...) {
   Function body 
}
```

* Name: the name you want for your function

* Arguments: a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the argument. A function can have as many arguments as you want to

* Function body: what the function does
]
---

# Example: Fahrenheit to Celsius

.font120[
```{r fah,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T}
# Call the function "temp.converter" and the argument "fahrenheit"
temp.converter <- function(fahrenheit) {
  (fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8   # what the function does
}

# Testing the function
temp.converter(0)   
temp.converter(50)  
temp.converter(-40)
```
]
---

# A Fancier Function

.font140[
* Let's create a function called `is.prime()` that identifies any prime number
```{r prime,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T}
# Call the function "is.prime" and the argument "num"
is.prime <- function(num) {
   if (num == 2) {
      cat("2 is the first prime number")
   } else if (any(num %% 2:(num-1) == 0)) { 
      cat(num, "is not a prime number", "\n") 
   } else { 
      cat(num, "is a prime number", "\n")
   }
}
```
]
---

# Testing the function

.font120[
```{r prime02,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T}
is.prime(2)
is.prime(10)
is.prime(7919)
is.prime(sqrt(81))
```
]
