# Today's Agenda

.font150[

* Brief recap

* Survey sampling methods 

* Social desirability bias

* List experiments 

* Final project

]

---

# Descriptive Statistics

.font150[
* Quantiles, quartiles, median, IQR, SD

* Standard deviation: average distance from points to the mean
	
	- $SD = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum^{n}_{i = 1} (x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2}}$  

* Outliers: 1.5x IQR

* Median is robust to outliers

* When $n$ is large, mean and median are roughly the same
]

---

# Bar Plots

.font150[
* Bar plots, histograms, box plots 

* Bar plots:

	- Describe factor variables
	- `barplot(prop.table(table(dataset$variable)))`
]

---

# Bar Plots

```{r, fig.align='center'}
afghan <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umbertomig/intro-prob-stat-FGV/master/datasets/afghan.csv")
barplot(prop.table(table(afghan$violent.exp.taliban)), main = "Taliban Victimization Rate")
```

---

# Histograms

.font150[
* Histograms

	- Describe numeric variables
	- Show the shape of the variable distribution
	- Densities are .orange[not] percentiles
	- Densities are the proportion of _each bin_
	- `hist(dataset$variable, freq = FALSE)`
]

---

# Histograms

```{r, fig.align='center'}
hist(afghan$age, main = "Age Distribution", freq = FALSE)
```


---

# Box Plots

.font150[
* Box plots

	- Distribution of a numeric variable
	- Quartiles, median, IQR, outliers
	- `boxplot(variable ~ group)` (where `~ group` is optional)
]
---

# Box Plots

```{r, fig.align='center'}
boxplot(afghan$age ~ afghan$province, main = "Age Distribution by province")
```

# Survey Sampling

.font130[Last primaries:]

.pull-left[
#### Democratic candidates

* Hillary Clinton 44%
* Bernie Sanders 26% 
* Joe Biden 20%
]

.pull-right[
#### Republican candidates

* Donald Trump 26%
* Ben Carson 15%
* Carly Fiorina 10%
* Jeb Bush 9%
* Marco Rubio 9%
* Ted Cruz 6%
]

.font110[Source: Huffington Post, Pollster]

.font130[
* Most polls only interview several hundred voters
]

.font130[
* Goal: infer what 200 million voters are thinking

# The 1936 Literary Digest Poll

.font150[
* Mail questionnaire to 10 million people

* Final sample size: over 2.3 million returned

* Addresses came from phone books and club memberships

* The young Gallup used 50,000 respondents

# The 1936 Literary Digest Poll

.font150[
* Why did the Literary Digest get the numbers so wrong?

# Quota Sampling vs Random Sampling

.font150[
* **Quota sampling:** Sample certain groups until quota is filled

* Problem: Unobservables can bias the results
]
--
.font150[
* **Random sampling:** Random draws without replacement from the population

* Everybody has the same chance of being in the sample

* Problem: _none_, sample is unbiased! 
]
---

# Random Sampling

.font150[
* Not every single sample will match all characteristics of the population exactly

* But as the number of samples gets larger (say 1000 samples of 1000 respondents), on average the samples would be representative

* Polls are associated with _uncertainty_: plus or minus a number

* But getting a random sample is _hard_
]

---

# Difficulties

.font130[
* Problems of telephone survey
  - Random digit dialing from phone book
  - Wealthy individuals have higher changes of being called
  - Caller ID screening (unit non-response)

* Problems of internet survey
  - Non-probability sampling
  - Cheap but non-representative
  - Young, urban, rich groups are overrepresented
  - Requires statistical corrections (usually weights)

# Social Desirability Bias

.font150[
* Respondents sometimes do not state their true preferences

* Examples: support for drug use, abortion, etc

* Under- or overestimation of true proportion
]

---

# List Experiments

.font150[
* .orange[List experiments] can minimize the problem

* Grant anonymity to respondents

* Control group sees a list of statements

* Treatment group sees the same list _plus a sensitive item_

* _Assuming that respondents don't lie and that both groups would answer the same number of non-sensitive items_, we can infer their true preferences
]

# Racial Attitudes

.font150[
* Example based on Graeme Blair and Kosuke Imai, 2012, [Statistical Analysis of List Experiments](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41403738), _Political Analysis_ 20(1), 47-77. 
]

# Racial Attitudes

.font150[
* Control group: 

Now  I’m  going  to  read  you  three  things  that  sometimes  make  people  angry or upset. After I read all three, just tell me HOW MANY of them upset you. (I don’t want to know which ones, just how many.)

1) "the federal government increasing the tax on gasoline;"

2) "professional athletes getting million-dollar-plus salaries;"

3) "large corporations polluting the environment."

How many, if any, of these things upset you?

# List experiments

.font130[
* Treatment group: 

Now  I’m  going  to  read  you  four  things  that  sometimes  make  people  angryor upset. After I read all four, just tell me HOW MANY of them upset you. (I don’t want to know which ones, just how many.)

1) "the federal government increasing the tax on gasoline;"

2) "professional athletes getting million-dollar-plus salaries;"

3) "large corporations polluting the environment."

.orange[4) "a black family moving next door to you."]

How many, if any, of these things upset you?
