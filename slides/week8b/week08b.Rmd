# Linear Models and RCTs

.font150[
* .orange[When the data come from a randomized experiment,] model parameters have a causal interpretation

* Treatment status as the independent variable (0 or 1)
  - 0 indicates control group
  - 1 indicates treatment group
]

.font150[
* $Y = \alpha + \beta \times treatment + \epsilon$
]

.font150[
* What is the interpretation of $\alpha$ here?

* What is the interpretation of $\beta$ here?

# Women as Policy Makers

.font120[
* Do women promote different policies than men?

* Observational studies: compare policies adopted by female politicians with those adopted by male politicians

* Randomized natural experiment:
  - one third of village council heads reserved for women
  - assigned at the level of Gram Panchayat (village council) since mid-1990s
  - each GP has multiple villages

* Hypothesis: female politicians represent the interests of female voters

* Female voters complain about drinking water while male voters complain about irrigation

# Data

| Name         | Description                                                                                                                |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GP`         | An identifier for the Gram Panchayat (village council)                                                                     |
| `village`    | identifier for each village                                                                                                |
| `reserved`   | binary variable indicating whether the GP was reserved for women leaders or not                                            |
| `female`     | binary variable indicating whether the GP had a female leader or not                                                       |
| `irrigation` | variable measuring the number of new or repaired irrigation facilities in the village since the reserve policy started     |
| `water`      | variable measuring the number of new or repaired drinking-water facilities in the village since the reserve policy started |

```{r data,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T}
women <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umbertomig/intro-prob-stat-FGV/master/datasets/women.csv")

# Models

.font110[
* Does the reservation policy increase female politicians?

```{r m1,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T}
tapply(women$female, women$reserved, mean)
```

* Does it change the policy outcomes?
```{r m2,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T}
# drinking-water facilities
tapply(women$water, women$reserved, mean)

# irrigation facilities
tapply(women$irrigation, women$reserved, mean)
```
]

# Slope Coefficient = Difference-in-Means

.font120[
```{r women03,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T,highlight.output=2}
tapply(women$water, women$reserved, mean)
```
```{r women04,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T,highlight.output=1}
mean(women$water[women$reserved == 1]) - mean(women$water[women$reserved == 0])
```
```{r women05,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T,highlight.output=7}
lm(water ~ reserved, data = women)
```

# Resume Experiment Revisited

.font100[

* Our turn: let's analyze the resume dataset!

1. Load the dataset
2. Run a regression on callback and race

```{r soc01,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T}
# Need to get these results: baseline (black) + 
# the effect of having a white-sounding name
0.06448 + 0.03203
```
]
---

# Call Rates and Gender

.font110[
* Now, let's add a gender indicator

1. Run a regression on callback rates and gender
]
---

# Race + Gender

.font120[

* Now, run a regression for both gender and race...

```{r soc02a,fig.align="center",tidy=F,warning=F,message=F,cache=T}
# Call rates for a white male
 0.066534 + 0.032130 - 0.009128
```
* Regression Equation: $Y = 0.066 + 0.032*white - 0.009*male + \epsilon$
]
---

# Interpreting Multiple Predictors

.font150[
* .orange[Ceteris Paribus]: _holding everything else constant_

* Let's interpret the coefficient for _white_ in $Y = 0.066 + 0.032 \times white - 0.009 \times male + \epsilon$

* We say: "_all else equal, having a white-sounding name increases the change of getting a job call in about 3%. Since candidates with black-sounding names a job call rate of about 6%, candidates with white-sounding names are 50% more likely to get a call_"
]

---

# Adjusted R-Squared

.font140[
* When we have more than one independent variable, we need to modify the $R^2$ formula to account for those additional variables

* $R^2$ measures the overall impact of _all_ variables at once, but some might just add noise to the model

* Every predictor added to a model increases $R^2$ and never decreases it

* Adjusted $R^2$ compensates for the addition of variables and only increases _if the new term enhances the model_

* It is usually lower than regular $R^2$ but not much

# K-Means

.font150[
* Suppose you work on consulting, and have the following problem

* Your boss wants to know which countries are similar in terms of risk

* She wants you to group countries that present similarities, in a way that groups are different from each other, but within groups, as similar as possible.

* You can use K-Means!

* Let's try this for the US Congres...
