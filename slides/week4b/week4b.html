# Today's Agenda

.font150[
* Quantiles

* Standard deviation

* Observational studies vs RCTs (QSS 2.5-2.6)

* Differences in Differences

* Leader assassination DiD 

* Internal and external validity

* Replication crisis

# Revision

.font150[
* What is the fundamental problem of causal inference?

* How can we (try to) solve that problem?

# Randomization

.font150[
* Randomization ensures the treatment .orange[is not correlated] with any other variable

* Randomization .orange[generates balance] between treatment and control groups 

* Treatment and control groups .orange[identical on average]

* Allows us to estimate the average treatment effect simply as a .orange[difference in means]: `\(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \{Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)\}\)`
]

# Social Pressure Example

.font150[
* August 2006 Primary State-wide Election in Michigan

* Send postcards with different, randomly-assigned messages
  - no message (control group)
  - civic duty message
  - "you are being studied" message (Hawthorne effect)
  - neighbourhood social pressure message
]

---

# Social Pressure Example




```r
tapply(social$yearofbirth, social$messages, mean) # Year of Birth
```

```
## Civic Duty    Control  Hawthorne  Neighbors 
*##   1956.341   1956.186   1956.295   1956.147
```

```r
tapply(social$hhsize, social$messages, mean) # Household size
```

```
## Civic Duty    Control  Hawthorne  Neighbors 
*##   2.189126   2.183667   2.180138   2.187770
```

```r
tapply(social$primary2006, social$messages, mean) # Outcome

## Civic Duty    Control  Hawthorne  Neighbors

# Quantiles

.font150[
* Sometimes it is useful to look at the distribution of a given variable

* We can split a variable in many ways:
	- Quartiles
	- Quantiles
	- Percentiles

* Which quantile is the median?
]
---

# Quantiles

.font150[
* What is the median of {2, 5, 6, 10}?

* What is the median of {1, 2, 3, 4, 20}?

* Interquartile range (IQR): the difference between the 75th and the 25th percentile    
]

---

# Standard Deviation

.font150[
* Average distance of each data point to the mean

* `\(SD = (\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum^{N}_{i = 1} (x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2}})\)`
]
--

.font150[
* where `\(\bar{x}\)` indicates the sample mean, that is, `\(\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum^{N}_{i = 1} x_{i}\)`, and `\(n\)` is the sample size 

* Almost all data entries are located within 2 or 3 standard deviations from the mean

# Observational Studies

.font150[
* Often, it is unethical or infeasible to randomize the treatment. 
  - Smoking and cancer 
  - Gender and salary
  - Death penalty and crime

* .orange[Observational data]: the treatment is naturally assigned
]

---

# Observational Studies 

.font150[
* Why is it harder to make causal inference with observational data? 
]

--
.font150[
* .orange[Confounders/confounding variables:] variables that are associated both with the treatment and the outcome 
]
--

.font150[
* If the treatment is not independent from pre-treatment variables, we cannot be sure about what causes what
]

---

# Examples of Confounders:

.font150[
* Are incumbents more likely to win elections?
  - Maybe, but they also receive more campaign donations
]
--

.font150[
*  Are democratic countries more peaceful than authoritarian ones?
   - Maybe, but they also tend to be richer
]

--

.font150[
* .orange[Selection bias]: groups are not directly comparable
]

---

# Observation Studies

.font150[
* .orange[Pre-treatment variables] have to be .orange[controlled for], that is, _held constant_ in the analysis

* .orange[Statistical control]: we use statistical methods to create balance between treatment and control and emulate an experiment as best as we can. E.g:
  - Instrumental variables (IV)
  - Regression discontinuity designs (RDD)
  - Differences-in-differences (DD/DiD/Diff-in-diff)
]

---

# Differences-in-Differences (DiD)

.font150[
* Compare trends before and after the treatment across the same units

* Controls for the initial conditions

* Requires data for two time periods (before and after treatment) and at least two units

* .orange[Parallel time trends assumption]
]

# Minimum Wage and Unemployment

.font120[
* How does the increase in minimum wage affect unemployment?

* Economists believe the effect is positive: higher wages lead to higher unemployment

* Difficult to randomize minimum wage legislation

* In 1992, NJ minimum wage increased from $4.25 to $5.05...

* ... but neighbouring PA stays at $4.25

* NJ and (eastern) PA are similar, and fast food chains are similar too: wages, prices, products, etc

* [David Card and Alan Krueger (1994)](http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/njmin-aer.pdf) see this change as a natural experiment

# Leader Assassination DD

Using the difference-in-difference approach, we find very little difference in the contries' polity score and in the proportion of countries engaged in war. Leader assassination does not seem to cause countries to democratise or engage in war.]

# Internal and External Validity

.font150[
* Because of randomization, we know that RCTs have strong _internal validity_

* .orange[Internal validity]: the degree to which we can attribute the results to the treatment and not to other factors

* However, observational studies have greater _external validity_

* .orange[External validity]: the extent to which the results can be generalized

# Wrap-up

.font150[
* Not all experiments are true, many don't replicate

* If possible, pre-register your hypotheses and make your data and code available (RMarkdown can help!)

* Replicate your and other people's work

* Is science wrong? _No_, but there are many wrong findings maskerading as science

* Keep those things in mind while reading a study that seems to good to be true: _it most likely is_]
